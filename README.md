# TypeScript Transformer Extension

A browser extension which watches the network for TypeScript source code and transforms
them to JavaScript.

This is an alternative approach to the
[JavaScript type annotations TC39 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-type-annotations/)
which should provide many of the same technical benefits without requiring changes to
the language specification.
